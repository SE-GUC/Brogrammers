Notes:\n * 1. \"Formatting\" units (e.g. formatting quarter) in the default en-US locale\n *    are the same as \"stand-alone\" units, but are different in some languages.\n *    \"Formatting\" units are declined according to the rules of the language\n *    in the context of a date. \"Stand-alone\" units are always nominative singular.\n *    In `format` function, they will produce different result:\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do LLLL', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopad'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do MMMM', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopadu'`\n *\n *    `parse` will try to match both formatting and stand-alone units interchangably.\n *\n * 2. Any sequence of the identical letters is a pattern, unless it is escaped by\n *    the single quote characters (see below).\n *    If the sequence is longer than listed in table:\n *    - for numerical units (`yyyyyyyy`) `parse` will try to match a number\n *      as wide as the sequence\n *    - for text units (`MMMMMMMM`) `parse` will try to match the widest variation of the unit.\n *      These variations are marked with \"2\" in the last column of the table.\n *\n * 3. `QQQQQ` and `qqqqq` could be not strictly numerical in some locales.\n *    These tokens represent the shortest form of the quarter.\n *\n * 4. The main difference between `y` and `u` patterns are B.C. years:\n *\n *    | Year | `y` | `u` |\n *    |------|-----|-----|\n *    | AC 1 |   1 |   1 |\n *    | BC 1 |   1 |   0 |\n *    | BC 2 |   2 |  -1 |\n *\n *    Also `yy` will try to guess the century of two digit year by proximity with `baseDate`:\n *\n *    `parse('50', 'yy', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Sat Jan 01 2050 00:00:00`\n *\n *    `parse('75', 'yy', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Wed Jan 01 1975 00:00:00`\n *\n *    while `uu` will just assign the year as is:\n *\n *    `parse('50', 'uu', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Sat Jan 01 0050 00:00:00`\n *\n *    `parse('75', 'uu', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Tue Jan 01 0075 00:00:00`\n *\n *    The same difference is true for local and ISO week-numbering years (`Y` and `R`),\n *    except local week-numbering years are dependent on `options.weekStartsOn`\n *    and `options.firstWeekContainsDate` (compare [setISOWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/setISOWeekYear}\n *    and [setWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/setWeekYear}).\n *\n * 5. These patterns are not in the Unicode Technical Standard #35:\n *    - `i`: ISO day of week\n *    - `I`: ISO week of year\n *    - `R`: ISO week-numbering year\n *    - `o`: ordinal number modifier\n *\n * 6. These tokens are often confused with others. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n *\n * Values will be assigned to the date in the descending order of its unit's priority.\n * Units of an equal priority overwrite each other in the order of appearance.\n *\n * If no values of higher priority are parsed (e.g. when parsing string 'January 1st' without a year),\n * the values will be taken from 3rd argument `baseDate` which works as a context of parsing.\n *\n * `baseDate` must be passed for correct work of the function.\n * If you're not sure which `baseDate` to supply, create a new instance of Date:\n * `parse('02/11/2014', 'MM/dd/yyyy', new Date())`\n * In this case parsing will be done in the context of the current date.\n * If `baseDate` is `Invalid Date` or a value not convertible to valid `Date`,\n * then `Invalid Date` will be returned.\n *\n * The result may vary by locale.\n *\n * If `formatString` matches with `dateString` but does not provides tokens, `baseDate` will be returned.\n *\n * If parsing failed, `Invalid Date` will be returned.\n * Invalid Date is a Date, whose time value is NaN.\n * Time value of Date: http://es5.github.io/#x15.9.1.1\n *\n * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:\n *\n * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).\n *\n * - Old `parse` was renamed to `toDate`.\n *   Now `parse` is a new function which parses a string using a provided format.\n *\n *   ```javascript\n *   // Before v2.0.0\n *   parse('2016-01-01')\n *\n *   // v2.0.0 onward\n *   toDate('2016-01-01')\n *   parse('2016-01-01', 'yyyy-MM-dd', new Date())\n *   ```\n *\n * @param {String} dateString - the string to parse\n * @param {String} formatString - the string of tokens\n * @param {Date|Number} baseDate - defines values missing from the parsed dateString\n * @param {Object} [options] - an object with options.\n * @param {Locale} [options.locale=defaultLocale] - the locale object. See [Locale]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/Locale}\n * @param {0|1|2|3|4|5|6} [options.weekStartsOn=0] - the index of the first day of the week (0 - Sunday)\n * @param {1|2|3|4|5|6|7} [options.firstWeekContainsDate=1] - the day of January, which is always in the first week of the year\n * @param {Boolean} [options.awareOfUnicodeTokens=false] - if true, allows usage of Unicode tokens causes confusion:\n *   - Some of the day of year tokens (`D`, `DD`) that are confused with the day of month tokens (`d`, `dd`).\n *   - Some of the local week-numbering year tokens (`YY`, `YYYY`) that are confused with the calendar year tokens (`yy`, `yyyy`).\n *   See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n * @returns {Date} the parsed date\n * @throws {TypeError} 3 arguments required\n * @throws {RangeError} `options.weekStartsOn` must be between 0 and 6\n * @throws {RangeError} `options.firstWeekContainsDate` must be between 1 and 7\n * @throws {RangeError} `options.locale` must contain `match` property\n * @throws {RangeError} `options.awareOfUnicodeTokens` must be set to `true` to use `XX` token; see: https://git.io/fxCyr\n *\n * @example\n * // Parse 11 February 2014 from middle-endian format:\n * var result = parse('02/11/2014', 'MM/dd/yyyy', new Date())\n * //=> Tue Feb 11 2014 00:00:00\n *\n * @example\n * // Parse 28th of February in Esperanto locale in the context of 2010 year:\n * import eo from 'date-fns/locale/eo'\n * var result = parse('28-a de februaro', \"do 'de' MMMM\", new Date(2010, 0, 1), {\n *   locale: eo\n * })\n * //=> Sun Feb 28 2010 00:00:00\n */\n\nexport default function parse(dirtyDateString, dirtyFormatString, dirtyBaseDate, dirtyOptions) {\n  if (arguments.length < 3) {\n    throw new TypeError('3 arguments required, but only ' + arguments.length + ' present');\n  }\n\n  var dateString = String(dirtyDateString);\n  var formatString = String(dirtyFormatString);\n  var options = dirtyOptions || {};\n  var locale = options.locale || defaultLocale;\n\n  if (!locale.match) {\n    throw new RangeError('locale must contain match property');\n  }\n\n  var localeFirstWeekContainsDate = locale.options && locale.options.firstWeekContainsDate;\n  var defaultFirstWeekContainsDate = localeFirstWeekContainsDate == null ?
